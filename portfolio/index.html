          <h3>
            <span class="bold">Personalizable Display Frame</span> -- Internet of Things Picture Frame
          </h3>
          <p>
            Personalizable Display Frame was created by Karan Shah and myself at the behest of a
            third-party client during the course of EECS 347-I and II (Microprocessor System
            Projects) at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to create an Internet-enabled picture frame, similar to
            other products currently on the market, with an accompanying management web application.
            The key feature of our product is a design targeting usage in nonpersonal spaces such as
            a hotel room or a shared office-- users can add photos to the system via the application,
            and then have their personal photos displayed when appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user planning to stay in a hotel that utilizes the Personalizable
            Display Frame system could log into the application and upload a set of personal photos.
            When the time comes for the user's stay in the hotel, the hotel manager simply accesses
            the application and links the frame in the user's room to the user's profile. When the
            user enters the room, the frame will already be displaying their pictures. All the users
            need to do is add pictures, and all the managers need to do is choose which user's
            pictures to show.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used Amazon Web Services (specfically Elastic Cloud Compute and Relational Database
            Service) to host our application in order to practice utilizing cloud services and to
            simulate a system that could be easily expanded to larger scales as necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used the following technologies to implement our design:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Web Application
                <ul class="italic smallText">

            <span class="bold"> Image Mosiac </span> -- Computer Vision
          </h3>
          <p>
            Image Mosiac System was created by Francesco Spadafora and myself during the course of EECS 332 Introduction to Computer Vision at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a program that can stitch different images to create a panorama.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everybody knows this situation: you see a beautiful panorama and want to take a picture of that. Unfortunately, the whole panorama does not fit in one image. Or maybe you want to take a detailed photo of a room. In such cases it would be great to make multiple images and stitch them all together. In this project, we designed a code which enables the user to form a panorama from different images. We wrote a MATLAB-function that takes an arbitrary number of images as input and stitches them to a panorama.

            <span class="bold"> Power-House Surveillance </span> -- Embedded Systems Webcam
          </h3>
          <p>
            Power house Surveillance was created by Hannah Emnett and myself during the course of EECS
            495 Engineering System Design I and II at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a modified controllable webcam for remote observation and motion detection via a web application. There are three key components of this design: the embedded webcam,
            the web application and server, and motion detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The embedded webcam was created using an ATSAM4S8b microcontroller with an OV2640DS
            camera module and an AMW004 WiFi module, using a custom circular PCB design we created
            using Eagle PCB. The web application and server were hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, using a
            NodeRED and Nginx server for the back end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. We
            experimented with using both websockets and a TCP during the course of our
            project- our final code relies on HTTP POST to transfer images from the webcam to the
            remote server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The major aspects of this design were the motion detector, the embedded PCB, and the remote server and application. We experimented with using both websockets and RESTful style throughout the course of the project--the final implementation relies on TCP connection to send our images to the server.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Swtiched Capacitor 2:1 Dc-Dc Voltage Converter was designed by me during the course of EECS 495 Advanced Low Power Digital and Mixed Signal Circuit Design at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to create switched capacitor based voltage regulator circuit and test the hypothesis of a published paper. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The model designed is a 2:1 DC-DC voltage converter. Input voltage is provided with 1.2V and 3 PMOS and
            1 NMOS transistors makes for a total of four switches
            which are provided with Vpulse (Vphase) thus making
            circuit work in 2 phases. During the first phase
            Transistors 1 and 3 works thus, charging the capacitor
            while in second phase transistors 2 and 4 operates thus
            giving the output and the ideal output of 0.6 V is
            obtained near load of 1-1.1kΩ. Also, there are two
            capacitors used in total; one acts as a flying capacitor
            while other as an output capacitor. The circuit and layout was designed using Cadence Virtuoso.

            This project was the capstone project for B.E. at Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering. The goal of the project was to design a rescue robot controlled by a mobile application 
          </p>
          <p>
            We build a portable fire evacuation guide robot system that can be thrown into a fire site to gather environmental information, search displaced people, and evacuate them from fire ste. This light mobile robot can be easily carried and remotely controlled by means of bluetooth.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project features a robotic arm which has a six degree freedom. The arm is divided into different parts which are controlled by servo motor. 
            The motors are connected to arduino and controlled by bluetooth using a mobile phone app. The mobile phone application was designed using MIT Appinventor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arm is located on top of a robotic car. The car contains different sensors that measure the enviromental parameters such as humidity, carbon monoxide, temperature and ultasonic. A camera unit is also installed to capture the images and send it to the controller.
